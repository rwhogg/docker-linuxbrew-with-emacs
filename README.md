# Dockerfile for Linuxbrew with Emacs

This is *not* meant to replace the canonical Linuxbrew Docker image.
Rather, it exists because trying to work on the Linuxbrew Docker image and having to download Emacs every single time
you restart it is a pointless waste of bandwidth and time.

To ensure it does not lead to misleading dependencies, I'm using the Ubuntu rather than Homebrew version of Emacs.
